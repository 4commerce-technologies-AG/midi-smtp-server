<h2>HAProxy load-balancing</h2>

HAProxy load-balancing recipe shows how to use one or more HAProxy instances to load-balance incoming connections
across multiple smtp backends.

The recipe comes with simple SMTP server that can be used as a backend for HAProxy. The server is based
on `midi-smtp-server`
and prints the proxy and sender information to the console.

Take a look at the example recipe in
the [cookbook/recipe-haproxy](https://github.com/4commerce-technologies-AG/midi-smtp-server/tree/master/cookbook/recipe-haproxy)
folder. Have fun to use and extend this recipe for your own ideas and needs.
